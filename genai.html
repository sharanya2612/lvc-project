            <b>Generative AI</b> is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on creating new, original content from existing data. Unlike traditional AI, which primarily performs tasks such as classification, regression, or prediction based on predefined data, Generative AI models are capable of generating novel data, such as images, text, audio, and video, that mimic the patterns or structures found in the training data.
        </p>
        <p>
            It has been used across various domains such as <b>artificial art generation</b>, <b>music composition</b>, <b>natural language processing</b>, and even the generation of realistic images and videos. One popular example of Generative AI is OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer), which can generate human-like text based on prompts given by users.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another example is <b>Deepfake</b> technology, which uses generative models to create hyper-realistic videos of people saying or doing things they never actually did. While these advancements have revolutionized multiple fields, they also raise important ethical and societal questions.
        </p>

            Below are a few images that illustrate the capabilities of generative models in different fields.
