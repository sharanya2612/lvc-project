            <b>Node.js</b> is a popular, open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code on the server side. Built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js is designed to build scalable and high-performance applications, making it ideal for real-time web applications, APIs, and microservices.
        </p>
        <p>
            Node.js uses a non-blocking, event-driven architecture, which makes it highly efficient and lightweight for I/O-heavy operations such as handling multiple requests or streaming data. It is widely used for building networked applications, including web servers, RESTful APIs, and chat applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the key advantages of Node.js is its ability to use JavaScript on both the client and server side, allowing for seamless development across both environments. It also has a vast ecosystem of libraries and modules through npm (Node Package Manager), which simplifies development by providing ready-made solutions for common problems.
