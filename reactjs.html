            <b>React.js</b> is a popular JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, primarily for single-page applications. React allows developers to build reusable UI components, which makes it easier to develop dynamic and interactive web applications. It uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to improve performance by efficiently updating the actual DOM when the state of an application changes.
        </p>
        <p>
            React is based on the component-based architecture, where the user interface is divided into smaller, reusable components. Each component manages its own state and renders the UI based on the current state. This modularity makes it easier to develop and maintain complex UIs.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the key advantages of React is its declarative syntax, which allows developers to describe how the UI should look at any given point in time. React also integrates well with other libraries and frameworks, making it a popular choice for both small and large-scale applications.
