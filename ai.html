            <b>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</b> refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, decision-making, speech recognition, visual perception, language translation, and more. AI systems utilize algorithms and data to recognize patterns, improve over time, and make autonomous decisions. With its diverse applications in industries such as healthcare, finance, education, and entertainment, AI is transforming the way we live and work. It holds the potential to revolutionize fields like robotics, automation, and personalized services, while also raising important questions about ethics, privacy, and the future of human labor.
