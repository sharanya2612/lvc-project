            <b>Express.js</b> is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to build web and mobile applications. It simplifies the development of server-side logic by providing a range of tools for routing, middleware, and handling HTTP requests. Express is one of the most popular frameworks in the Node.js ecosystem.

        <p>
            Express.js is designed to be lightweight and fast, with minimal setup required. It allows developers to create RESTful APIs, serve static files, and manage routing in a simple and efficient manner. Express is widely used in backend development, especially in conjunction with Node.js to create scalable and performance-oriented web applications.

            One of the key advantages of using Express is its middleware architecture, which allows you to add functionality at various stages of the request-response cycle. This makes it easy to implement features such as authentication, logging, error handling, and session management.
