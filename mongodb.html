            <b>MongoDB</b> is a popular, open-source, document-oriented NoSQL database management system. Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, making it easier to scale, store complex data types, and manage large datasets.
        </p>
        <p>
            MongoDB is designed for high performance, high availability, and easy scalability. It is used in many modern applications, ranging from small projects to large-scale enterprise solutions. Some of its features include flexible data models, powerful querying capabilities, and support for large-scale data replication and sharding.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the key advantages of MongoDB is its ability to handle unstructured or semi-structured data. This makes it a great choice for applications that require rapid iteration or have evolving data structures. It also provides features like automatic failover and built-in replication, ensuring reliability and uptime.
