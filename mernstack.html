                    <b>MERN Stack</b> is a collection of JavaScript-based technologies used for building full-stack web applications. The stack is composed of four key technologies that are highly popular in modern web development: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. The combination of these technologies allows developers to build scalable, high-performance, and dynamic web applications using a single language, JavaScript.

                <p>
                    <b>MongoDB</b> is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like formats, making it ideal for handling large-scale, unstructured data.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    <b>Express.js</b> is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that simplifies the development of web applications by providing a robust set of features to build web and mobile applications.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    <b>React.js</b> is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of complex applications efficiently, making it the go-to choice for building dynamic single-page applications.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    <b>Node.js</b> is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to run JavaScript code server-side. Itâ€™s known for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, which makes it ideal for building scalable network applications.
