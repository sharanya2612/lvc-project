            <b>Deep Learning (DL)</b> is a subset of machine learning that focuses on algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, known as artificial neural networks. Deep learning models are designed to automatically learn from vast amounts of data and identify patterns or features in complex datasets, such as images, audio, and text. Unlike traditional machine learning models, which require feature extraction and manual tuning, deep learning models excel in tasks that involve unstructured data, thanks to their ability to learn hierarchical representations.

            Deep learning has driven significant advancements in areas like <b>computer vision</b>, <b>natural language processing</b>, and <b>speech recognition</b>. Popular deep learning architectures include <b>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</b> for image recognition, <b>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)</b> for sequence data, and <b>Transformer models</b> for language tasks. The availability of large datasets and powerful computational resources, such as GPUs, has greatly accelerated the progress of deep learning, enabling breakthroughs in autonomous vehicles, healthcare diagnostics, virtual assistants, and much more.
