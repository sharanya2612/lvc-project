            <b>MEAN Stack</b> is another popular collection of technologies used for developing full-stack web applications. The MEAN stack is composed of four main technologies that are JavaScript-based, enabling developers to build both client-side and server-side applications using a single language (JavaScript). The MEAN stack consists of MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>MongoDB</b> is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format. It is known for its scalability and ease of use in handling large volumes of unstructured data.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Express.js</b> is a lightweight framework for building web applications and APIs in Node.js. It simplifies the creation of routes, middleware, and overall request handling.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Angular</b> is a front-end framework developed by Google for building dynamic, single-page web applications. It provides a comprehensive solution for building modern web applications, including two-way data binding and dependency injection.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Node.js</b> is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side. It is highly efficient for building scalable applications due to its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model.
