            <b>Angular</b> is a popular open-source web application framework developed and maintained by Google. It is designed to build dynamic, single-page applications (SPAs) with a powerful set of tools, including two-way data binding, dependency injection, and modular development. Angular is based on TypeScript, providing a robust framework for building scalable and maintainable applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            Angular uses a component-based architecture, where each part of the UI is encapsulated into reusable components. This makes it easier to develop, test, and maintain large-scale applications. Angular also provides features like routing, form handling, HTTP client services, and animation support out of the box, making it a comprehensive solution for building complex web applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the key advantages of Angular is its powerful tooling ecosystem, including the Angular CLI, which automates many tasks such as project setup, building, testing, and deployment. Angular's built-in RxJS support allows for reactive programming and handling asynchronous events with ease.
